# NEONLidarFSDPointDensity
Evaluating the sensitivity of forest structural diversity characterization to LiDAR point density 

Authors:
Elizabeth A. LaRue (ealarue@utep.edu), Robert Fahey, Tabatha L. Fuson, Jane R. Foster, Jaclyn Hatala Matthes, Brady S. Hardiman

Collated data from LaRue et al. is provided here so that the compiled data, Tables, Figures can be 
generated from provided code in R version 3.6.3. 

Note that LiDAR is available for public and free download from the neonUtilities of neonscience.org, therefore LiDAR data products are not provided with the code or .csv files of plot coordinates or FSD metrics used in analyses. 


Two folders are provided: code and data

data contains raw and intermediate data files to create the data files needed to run analyses. It also contains output of analyses.
Raw lidar data was downloaded from the NEON site April 23 2021. 

code contains the R codes on how to collate data to obtain forest structural diversity variables at the plot-level from different
simulated lidar point densities across 5 NEON sites. It also contains codes to run the analyses for the Tables, Figures, and Supplemental Data.
