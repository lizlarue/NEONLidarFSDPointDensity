Project title: Evaluating the sensitivity of forest structural diversity characterization to LiDAR point density 
Authors:
Elizabeth A. LaRue (ealarue@utep.edu), Robert Fahey, Tabatha L. Fuson, Jane R. Foster, Jaclyn Hatala Matthes, Brady S. Hardiman

Code from LaRue et al. is provided here so that the compiled data, Tables, Figures, and Supplemental Information can be 
generated from provided code in R version 3.6.3. 

Seven .R files are run in sequential order as indicated by 00, 01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06: 

00_neonUtilities.R - Download aerial LiDAR data from NEON for the 9 plots selected at each of 5 different sites.

01_process_NEON_lidar_.R - Processes the raw level 1 LiDAR downloaded from NEON website by clipping to plot size, removing
outliers, and correcting for elevation. Intermediate files are listed in the code annotations and stored in the data folder.

02_simulated_density.R - Randomly simulates a specified point density from processed baseplot LiDAR clips. 

03_FSD_metrics_loop.R - A for loop to calculate 16 FSD metrics highlighted in the manuscript analyses from the lidR and leafR packages. Creates the metrics table density_FSD_08172021.csv used in analyses and figures. A separate file density_FSD_08172021.csv was created in excel for NMS multivariate analyses (Fig. 4) in PCORD run by R. Fahey. 

04_fig1.R - Generates figure 1. 

05_fig2_3.R - Generates figure 2 and 3 plots of FSD metrics across LiDAR point densities. 

06_table3_S1.R - Runs segmented regression analyses on each plot by metric combination, which is shown in
Table 2 and the Appendix Table S1.
